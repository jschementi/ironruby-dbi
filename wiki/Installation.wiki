Getting ironruby-dbi to work with IronRuby


= Details =
To install ironruby-dbi it should should suffice to extract the files you find in the ironruby-dbi archive to the libs folder of your ironruby installation.

For example I track the git repository for updates to ironruby and the git repository is cloned into *C:\tools\ironruby* 

To install ironruby-dbi these are the steps you need to take:
  * Extract the archive
  * Copy the files to ruby/site_ruby/1.8 
(on my machine the full path is: _C:\tools\ironruby\merlin\external\languages\ruby\redist-libs\ruby\site_ruby\1.8_)

Start accessing databases :)
