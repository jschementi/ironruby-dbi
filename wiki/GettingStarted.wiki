= Introduction =

The DBI implementation for IronRuby has a special connection string to allow specifying a provider to use.

= Details =

To get started with ironruby-dbi you can reference the documentation of the [http://ruby-dbi.rubyforge.org/ ruby-dbi project].
There is one difference in the way you connect to a database.

In ruby-dbi the connection string to a mssql database would be something like:

`DBI.connect('DBI:ADO:datasource=(local);initial catalog=MyDatabase;user id=user;password=password')`

To connect to the same database but using ADO.NET you would write the following connection string.

`DBI.connect('DBI:ADONET:MSSQL:datasource=(local);initial catalog=MyDatabase;user id=user;password=password')`

There has been an extra colon defined to select the provider that ADO.NET should use to access the database. So instead of just specifying the driver *DBI:_ADO_:* which is ADO in this example. You now have to tell DBI that it needs to use the ADO.NET driver with the MSSQL provider *DBI:_ADONET_:_MSSQL_*.

The providers that are installed by default are:

||Provider type||Provider name||Description||
||ODBC||System.Data.Odbc||Connect to ODBC datasources||
||OLEDB||System.Data.OleDb||Connect to OleDb datasources like ms access||
||ORACLE||System.Data.OracleClient||Connect to Oracle databases||
||MSSQL||System.Data.SqlClient||Connect to Microsoft Sql Server databases||
||SQLCE||System.Data.SqlServerCe.3.5||Connect to Microsoft Sql CE databases||

I also installed the MySQL .NET connector library and the Sqlite providers so for me the following 2 are also available:

||Provider type||Provider name||Description||
||MYSQL||MySql.Data.MySqlClient||Connect to MySql databases||
||SQLITE||System.Data.SQLite||Connect to Sqlite databases||
